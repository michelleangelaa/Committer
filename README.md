# Committer
An entree for Online Competition Logikain 2020 Thunkable Edition held by Barchelor of Information Technology Swiss German University

Hello guys 🖐️ Nongkage here! We are three high school students that joined this competition to experience coding in our last academic year. ⁣
⁣
On this occasion, we would like to introduce you to our alpha release of an online scheduling application "Committer" which is made by us using Thunkable.⁣
⁣
This app is made based on our experience when we were struggling to use our time efficiently during the quarantine 🤔⏰. We should have used our time to be productive and increase our knowledge, but we ruined it because of a lot of distraction and  we couldn't set our schedule well😥.⁣
⁣
To solve this problem, we created an application that will help us in setting our schedule, and remind us to do something based on what we wrote in the to-do list ☑️.⁣
⁣
For your information, this application is solely for the purpose of helping you finish your tasks. It is only you who can control yourself 😊.

Collaborated with:
David Gracia & Darren Huela
